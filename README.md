# AI-Powered-Product-Recommendation-Engine
# Introduction
An intelligent product recommendation system that works just like modern e-commerce platforms.
It uses AI embeddings and semantic search to deliver accurate product suggestions based on natural language queries.
# Dataset
Creates a dummy product catalog (titles, descriptions, URLs)
# Features
  Creates a dummy product catalog (titles, descriptions, URLs)
  Generates semantic embeddings using Sentence-Transforme
  Stores vectors in FAISS for lightning-fast similarity search
  Allows natural language search (e.g., “Compact waterproof camera for biking”)
  Provides instant product recommendations through a clean Gradio UI
# Tech Stack
Python 3.9+
Sentence-Transformers
 – for embeddings
FAISS
 – for similarity search
Gradio
 – for the user interface
CSV 
  – for the product catalog dataset
# Conclusion
This project shows how AI-powered recommendation systems make search smarter, faster, and more personalized. Even with a dummy dataset, it demonstrates the same core techniques used in real-world e-commerce and can easily be extended to production-ready applications.
